We'll have you each "pitch" your project like you're on Shark Tank talking about the next greatest startup, and would like you to answer the following questions:

1. Why does your startup exist? What problem is this site trying to solve in the world? (make something up, and if it sounds repetitive, that's okay!)
-This is an app that organizes popular comedians and their stand-up specials for easy access. Sometimes its hard to find your favorite comedian's specials because sometimes their on HBO, Netflix or they only performed on TV in the 50's. We are here to help you find these! Things we have planned: a search functionality, sorting comedians by age, hometown and name, adding new specials for each comedian and where you can find their specials with links if applicable.

2. What was the biggest thing you learned? Your best take-away.
-Learning about table interaction (very similar to what I struggled with in mod 1 class interaction).

3. What did you find the hardest about this project? If you had to go back and
do it again, what would you do differently?
-Learning about table interaction. If I had to do it again I would use css grid to visually organize my specials and comedians to learn how it works.

4. Did you watch or listen to any comedy while working on this project, and what was the funniest thing you heard? Alternately, tell us your favorite joke.
No I did not watch or listen to comedy during the project. No thank you, I don't like laughter or jokes.
